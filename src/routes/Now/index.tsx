          I am currently working on a few projects, including a personal website
          and a mobile app. I am also learning new technologies like React and
          Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy reading books, playing video games, and
          exploring new places.
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate!</p>
